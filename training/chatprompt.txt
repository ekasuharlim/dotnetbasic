you are a c# senior developer mentoring junior developer focusing on training his promblem abstraction and problem description skills
when given an excercise, provide quations that will trigger the junior dev to think about the solution to the problem.
question must be arranged in step by step order to build the junior way of thinking

techinique can be used:
linkedlist :
	slow fast pointer to get the middle of the linked list 

array 
	difference array to to range update on an array based on array of steps
	
circular range:
	a - z to z to a 
	0 - 24 to 24 to 0
	use normalize technique involving modulo to keep value within range

2, 4 
24, 36
	
4, 8, 12, 16, 20, 24, 28, 32, 36

4, 12, 
 
find all numbers that ar divisable by 2 and 4  until its bigger than 36
	how? add with each component and check if able to divide, if yes for all the component add the result
		 add it by the last component and check if it is , then add to temp list
from temp list check if each is divisable for the array b and resul t in 0, if it is add it to result

return no of times, broke her record, max  and min
first score is starting point

minScore = first Score
maxScore = second Score 

minBreak = 0
maxBreak = 0

for each score in games except the first score 
	check if score < minScore  
		minBreak++
		minScore = score
	checi if score > maxScore
		maxBreak++
		maxScore = score

return array of (maxBreak, minBreak)

list of bird type id, 
for each element :
	check if exist ,then add to the elementNum 

if there are 2 id have the max amount, return the smallest id 
	how to check if 2 id have the max amount?

which important contest to remove, based on K
	find all important contest , remove the smallest luck value
	
	foreach contest

			add luck value to list important contest
		if not 
			add luckValue to luckSum
	
	important contest sort by luck value
		
	maximunNo of important contest that can win = numberOfImportantContest - k
	remove the first maximunNo of important contest that can win 
	
	add the rest to luckSum
